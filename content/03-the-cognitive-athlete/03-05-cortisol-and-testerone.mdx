## The Trader Who Became Two Different People

Meet Sarah. Quantitative analyst. Former chess champion. IQ of 156. The kind of person who could calculate complex probability distributions in her head while most people were still looking for a calculator.

For two years, Sarah had been a consistently profitable trader. Nothing flashy—she averaged 3-4% per month with remarkably low drawdowns. Methodical. Systematic. Machine-like in her consistency.

Her friends joked that she was a robot. No emotion. Just logic. Pure execution.

Then, in May 2022, something strange started happening.

Sarah began noticing she was two completely different traders depending on one variable: whether she was winning or losing.

Winning Sarah:
After a string of three or four winning trades, Sarah felt invincible. Her confidence soared. She started seeing setups everywhere. Her entry criteria loosened—"That's close enough." Her position sizes crept up—"I'm on a roll, might as well capitalize."

She felt sharp. Alert. Powerful. Like she'd unlocked some deeper level of market understanding.

She'd walk into her trading room in the morning feeling like a predator. Chest out. Energy high. Ready to dominate.

Her analysis became more aggressive. She'd see a setup that was maybe 70% of her criteria and think: "I'm hot right now. I can make this work."

And sometimes she did. Which made the feeling even stronger.

Losing Sarah:
After a string of two or three losses, everything changed.

The same charts looked different. Where before she saw opportunity, now she saw danger. Her confidence evaporated. She second-guessed every decision.

Setups she would have taken confidently the week before now looked "too risky." She'd wait for confirmation, then more confirmation, then more—until the trade ran without her.

She felt foggy. Slow. Like she was thinking through mud.

She'd approach her trading desk with a sense of dread. Shoulders hunched. Energy low. Afraid to engage.

Her analysis became paralytically conservative. She'd see a perfect A-grade setup and think: "What if I'm wrong? What if this is another loss? Maybe I should wait."

And by the time she convinced herself to take it, the opportunity had passed.

<hr />

By June, Sarah was struggling. Not because her system had stopped working. Not because the markets had changed. But because she couldn't maintain psychological consistency.

Winning Sarah was overconfident and reckless.
Losing Sarah was paralyzed and timid.

And neither one was the methodical, systematic Sarah who'd been profitable for two years.

She came to me confused and frustrated: "I don't understand what's happening. It's like I'm two different people. When I'm winning, I feel like I can't lose. When I'm losing, I feel like I can't win. And I KNOW both of those are wrong, but I can't seem to stop the pattern."

I asked her a question that surprised her: "Are you a man or a woman?"

She looked at me like I was insane. "What does that have to do with anything?"

"Actually, everything. But the question isn't really about gender—it's about hormones. Tell me: Do you notice these patterns are more extreme at certain times of the month?"

Long pause. Then: "Oh my God. Yes. Mid-cycle, I'm way more aggressive. Week before my period, I can barely bring myself to trade."

"That's estrogen and progesterone interacting with your stress response. But we're going to focus on the two hormones that affect EVERY trader, male or female: cortisol and testosterone."

"What do those have to do with my trading?"

"Everything. Because they're literally changing your brain chemistry, your perception, your risk tolerance, and your decision-making. You're not going crazy. You're experiencing chemical warfare."

<hr />

This lesson is about the hormones that hijack your trading—not through your conscious thoughts, but through your biology.

Cortisol—the stress hormone that clouds your thinking, increases your risk aversion, and creates the spiral of fear that turns small losses into catastrophic ones.

Testosterone—the dominance hormone that makes you feel invincible after wins, increases your risk-taking, and creates the overconfidence that usually precedes account destruction.

These aren't metaphors. They're not psychological concepts. They're measurable chemicals flooding your bloodstream, crossing your blood-brain barrier, and fundamentally altering how you perceive risk, process information, and make decisions.

Your hormones are trading your account.

And until you understand how, you're fighting a war you don't even know you're in.

## CORTISOL - The Fog of War

### What Cortisol Actually Does

Cortisol is often called "the stress hormone," but that's oversimplified.

Cortisol is actually your body's mobilization hormone. Its job is to:

Convert stored energy (glycogen, fat, even muscle) into usable glucose
Suppress non-essential functions (digestion, reproduction, immune response)
Sharpen focus and attention (in the short term)
Prepare you for sustained physical and mental effort
In the right amounts, cortisol is performance-enhancing. It's what gets you out of bed in the morning. It's what helps you focus during challenges. It's what gives you energy to handle crises.

The problem isn't cortisol itself. The problem is chronic elevation.

Think of cortisol like a turbo boost in a car. Short bursts? Fantastic—you get extra power when you need it. But leave the turbo on constantly, and you'll destroy the engine.

Acute Stress (Helpful Cortisol):
You're about to give a presentation. Cortisol rises. You feel alert, focused, energized. Your memory sharpens. Your verbal fluency increases. You perform well.

After the presentation, cortisol drops back to baseline. System returns to normal.

This is cortisol working as designed.

Chronic Stress (Destructive Cortisol):
You have a presentation every day. Or you're in a losing streak. Or your account is in drawdown. Or you're trading with money you can't afford to lose.

Cortisol stays elevated. Not sky-high, but constantly above baseline. Day after day. Week after week.

This is cortisol destroying your performance.

### The Neurotoxic Effects of Chronic Cortisol

Here's what chronic cortisol elevation does to your brain:

1. Kills Neuroplasticity
   Remember from Lesson 1 that your brain can rewire itself (neuroplasticity)? Cortisol suppresses this.

High cortisol literally prevents the formation of new neural connections and can damage existing ones—particularly in the hippocampus (memory and learning) and prefrontal cortex (executive function).

Trading impact: You can't learn from your mistakes effectively. The lessons don't stick. You make the same errors repeatedly.

2. Impairs Working Memory
   Working memory is your mental scratch pad—the ability to hold and manipulate information in your mind temporarily.

It's what lets you:

Track multiple positions
Remember your entry thesis while managing the trade
Calculate risk-reward on the fly
Hold your trading plan in mind while price moves against you
Cortisol impairs working memory in a dose-dependent manner. The higher your cortisol, the smaller your effective working memory.

Trading impact: You forget your plan mid-trade. You lose track of your reasoning. You can't hold multiple data points in mind. Your analytical capacity drops.

3. Increases Risk Aversion
   High cortisol shifts your perception toward threat detection and away from opportunity recognition.

Your amygdala (threat detection) becomes hyperactive. Your prefrontal cortex (rational assessment) becomes less active.

Trading impact: You see danger everywhere. Good setups look risky. You wait for "more confirmation" that never comes. You miss trades or take positions that are too small to matter.

4. Narrows Cognitive Scope (Tunnel Vision)
   Under high cortisol, your attention narrows. You focus intensely on the immediate threat while losing peripheral awareness.

Trading impact: You fixate on one losing position while missing other opportunities. You can't see the bigger picture. You lose context. You're zoomed into the 1-minute chart when you should be looking at the 4-hour.

5. Suppresses Immune Function
   Chronic cortisol tells your body: "We're in crisis mode. Shut down non-essential systems."

Immune function is deemed "non-essential" during immediate threats.

Trading impact: You get sick more often during losing streaks. Colds. Infections. Fatigue. Your body is literally cannibalizing its own defense systems to fuel the stress response.

6. Disrupts Sleep Architecture
   High nighttime cortisol prevents deep sleep. You might fall asleep (eventually), but you don't get restorative slow-wave sleep or proper REM cycles.

Trading impact: You're tired all the time, but you can't sleep properly. Your brain can't consolidate memories or learning. Your decision-making deteriorates further. The spiral deepens.

7. Creates Visceral Fat Accumulation
   Chronic cortisol preferentially stores fat around your midsection (visceral fat).

Why? Because visceral fat near your organs can be quickly converted back to glucose during stress. It's your body preparing for prolonged crisis.

Trading impact: This isn't just cosmetic. Visceral fat produces inflammatory cytokines that further impair cognitive function.
It's a feedback loop.

### The Cortisol Spiral - How Losses Compound Stress

Here's the vicious cycle that destroys traders:

Stage 1: The Initial Loss

You take a loss. Your cortisol rises (acute stress response). This is normal.

Stage 2: Performance Impairment

Elevated cortisol impairs your decision-making slightly. Your next trade has a higher probability of error.

Stage 3: The Second Loss

You take another loss, partly due to the impairment from Stage 2.

Now your cortisol rises higher. You're not just stressed about this loss—you're stressed about the pattern of losses.

Stage 4: Significant Impairment

Cortisol is now significantly elevated. Working memory is impaired. Risk aversion is high. Attention is narrowed.

You're making substantially worse decisions, but you don't realize it because your self-monitoring (prefrontal cortex function) is also impaired.

Stage 5: Cascade

More losses follow, driven by cortisol-impaired decision-making.

Each loss raises cortisol further.
Higher cortisol impairs decision-making more.
Worse decisions create more losses.
More losses raise cortisol higher.

This is the cortisol spiral.

And it's why drawdowns accelerate. It's not just bad luck. It's neurochemical degradation of your cognitive capacity.

The Research:
A landmark study tracked cortisol levels in professional traders over several months.

Findings:

Cortisol levels rose during market volatility (expected)
Traders with highest cortisol levels showed poorest decision-making (expected)
But here's the key: Traders who had elevated cortisol from previous losses showed WORSE decision-making on the NEXT trade, even when that trade setup was completely different and independent
Conclusion: Prior losses create cortisol elevation that impairs future decision-making, creating a compounding effect.

This is why "just take a break after a loss" isn't psychological advice—it's neurochemical necessity.

You need time for cortisol to clear before your brain can function optimally again.

### Measuring and Managing Cortisol

How to Know if Your Cortisol Is Elevated:
Physical Signs:

Difficulty falling asleep despite being tired
Waking between 2-4 AM frequently
Craving salt or sugar
Can't lose belly fat despite diet/exercise
Feeling "wired but tired"
Getting sick frequently
Low libido
Digestive issues
Cognitive Signs:

Brain fog (can't think clearly)
Memory problems
Difficulty concentrating
Can't learn new information easily
Mental fatigue
Emotional Signs:

Irritability
Anxiety (especially about small things)
Feeling overwhelmed easily
Low frustration tolerance
Mood swings
Trading-Specific Signs:

Can't pull the trigger on good setups
Seeing danger everywhere
Paralysis by analysis
Cutting winners too early out of fear
Inability to stay in trades even when plan says hold
The Cortisol Clearing Protocol:
Immediate (0-1 hour after stressful trade):

✓ Deep Breathing: 5 minutes of box breathing or 4-7-8 technique
Why it works: Activates parasympathetic nervous system, signals "threat over"

✓ Cold Water: Splash cold water on face or brief cold shower
Why it works: Activates mammalian dive reflex, instantly drops heart rate and stress hormones

✓ Movement: 10-minute walk or light exercise
Why it works: Burns the cortisol-mobilized glucose, completing the stress cycle

✓ Sunlight: 10 minutes outside if possible
Why it works: Light exposure helps regulate cortisol rhythm

Same-Day (1-24 hours):

✓ No caffeine after the stress event: Caffeine + cortisol is multiplicative, not additive

✓ Protein-rich meal: Helps stabilize blood sugar, prevents cortisol spike from glucose crash

✓ Social connection: 20-minute conversation with someone you trust
Why it works: Releases oxytocin, which directly antagonizes cortisol

✓ Laughter: Watch something funny
Why it works: Laughter reduces cortisol measurably within minutes

✓ Evening routine: Dim lights after sunset, limit blue light, prepare for sleep

Long-Term (Chronic Elevation):

✓ Sleep prioritization: 7-9 hours, consistent schedule
Why it works: Sleep is when cortisol resets; chronic sleep deprivation = chronic cortisol elevation

✓ Regular exercise: Especially morning cardio
Why it works: Improves cortisol rhythm (high morning, low evening)

✓ Meditation/mindfulness: 10-20 minutes daily
Why it works: Reduces baseline cortisol; the effect is cumulative

✓ Adaptogenic herbs: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola (consult doctor)
Why it works: These herbs modulate cortisol response (clinical evidence)

✓ Time away from trading: If in chronic stress, take 1-2 weeks completely off

## TESTOSTERONE - The Winner Effect

### The Hormone of Dominance

Testosterone gets a bad rap. People think of it as the "aggression hormone" or "male hormone."

But testosterone is much more nuanced. Both men and women produce it (men typically 10-20x more, but women are more sensitive to fluctuations).

Testosterone's actual functions:

Confidence and self-assurance
Risk tolerance
Competitive drive
Spatial reasoning
Reward sensitivity
Social dominance seeking
Assertiveness
Energy and motivation
In the right amounts, testosterone is performance-enhancing. It gives you the confidence to take good trades, the assertiveness to execute your plan, the competitive drive to stick with trading through challenges.

The problem is when testosterone spikes above your baseline.

Because elevated testosterone doesn't just increase confidence—it increases overconfidence.

### The Winner Effect - When Winning Changes Your Brain

In 2008, researchers John Coates and Joe Herbert did something unprecedented: They measured real-time hormone levels in professional traders on a London trading floor.

They took saliva samples throughout the trading day and correlated hormone levels with trading performance.

The findings were shocking:

The Winner Effect:
When traders had a winning day, their testosterone levels rose an average of 20-25% from baseline.

When traders had winning streaks (multiple consecutive winning days), testosterone continued climbing day after day.

And here's the critical part: As testosterone rose, traders showed:

Increased risk-taking: Position sizes grew
Increased confidence: They rated their own skill higher
Increased search for risk: They took more trades, including lower-quality setups
Decreased fear response: They became less sensitive to danger signals
In moderate amounts, this creates positive momentum. You feel confident, you execute well, you win, your confidence increases slightly, you execute even better.

But past a certain threshold, the Winner Effect becomes destructive.

The Tipping Point:
At approximately 30-40% above baseline testosterone, the following happens:

Overconfidence: You believe your skill is greater than it actually is
Risk blindness: You stop seeing or respecting danger signals
Increased position sizing: You think you can handle more risk
"God Mode" mentality: You feel invincible, like you've "figured it out"
Reduced impulse control: You override your rules because "this is different"
Increased trading frequency: You see opportunities everywhere
This is the psychological state that usually precedes account destruction.

### The Cycle - From Winner Effect to Catastrophe

Let's map the typical progression:

Week 1-2: The Winning Streak
You catch a good run. Four, five, six winning trades. Everything clicking.

Testosterone rises to 10-15% above baseline.

Effect: Positive. Increased confidence, good execution, maintaining discipline.

Week 3-4: The Hot Streak
You're on fire. Ten, twelve wins out of fourteen trades. Best performance ever.

Testosterone now 25-35% above baseline.

Effect: Mixed. Very high confidence, but starting to take slightly larger positions and slightly lower-grade setups. Still winning, so it seems fine.

Week 5: God Mode
Everything you touch turns green. Fifteen out of seventeen winners.

Testosterone 40%+ above baseline.

Effect: Dangerous. You feel invincible. Your position sizes have crept up 50-100%. You're taking trades outside your system because "you have the touch right now." You're certain you've reached a new level of skill.

Friends and family comment that you seem different—more confident, more energetic, almost manic.

You're not sleeping much (high testosterone reduces sleep need temporarily), but you feel great.

Week 6: The Reversal
Market conditions change. Or variance catches up. Or you simply take a trade that doesn't work.

Your first significant loss in weeks.

Testosterone drops precipitously. Not back to baseline—it overshoots downward.

Simultaneously, cortisol spikes (stress response to loss).

You now have low testosterone + high cortisol—the worst possible combination.

Week 7-8: The Crash
Low testosterone effects:

Confidence evaporates
Risk tolerance collapses
Energy drops
Motivation disappears
Learned helplessness develops
High cortisol effects:

Impaired thinking
Increased fear
Narrowed attention
Poor decision-making
You can't pull the trigger on good setups. When you do trade, you cut winners early and hold losers long. Everything feels hard. You question whether you can trade at all.

This is the Loser Effect—the mirror image of the Winner Effect.

And it's just as dangerous, but in the opposite direction.

### The Gender Factor (And Why It Matters for Everyone)

Male traders:

Experience larger testosterone swings because they start from higher baseline.

Winner Effect and Loser Effect tend to be more extreme.

Testosterone peaks are often associated with overconfidence blowups.

Female traders:

Experience testosterone fluctuations plus estrogen and progesterone cycles.

Mid-cycle (around ovulation): Estrogen peaks, testosterone rises → increased risk-taking, confidence

Luteal phase (week before period): Progesterone high, testosterone relatively low → increased risk aversion, anxiety

Menstrual phase: All hormones drop → can feel like mini-"loser effect"

Sarah's pattern made sense:

Mid-cycle: High estrogen + testosterone → aggressive trading, Winner Effect
Pre-menstrual: Progesterone dominant, testosterone low → paralyzed trading, Loser Effect

For female traders: Track your cycle alongside your trading performance. You'll likely see clear patterns. Adjust position sizing accordingly.

For all traders: The specific hormones may differ, but the principle is universal: Your hormonal state is trading your account.

### The Coates Study Extended - The Physical Changes

The hormone changes aren't just mental. They're physical:

High Testosterone Physical Effects:
Increased facial blood flow (you look flushed, healthier)
Widened stance (body language becomes more expansive)
Deeper voice
Increased grip strength
Faster reaction times
Reduced perception of pain
Enhanced spatial reasoning
You literally become a different person physically.

The Trading Floor Observation:
Coates noted that successful traders on winning streaks would:

Stand differently (more expansive posture)
Speak more loudly
Make more assertive gestures
Take up more physical space
Show more dominant body language toward peers
They weren't consciously doing this. Their testosterone was doing it.

And here's the feedback loop: Dominant body language increases testosterone further (the "power pose" effect).

So winners become more testosterone-elevated, which makes them more confident and risk-seeking, which makes them trade bigger, which—when variance turns—creates catastrophic losses.

### The Testosterone Management Protocol

How to Recognize Elevated Testosterone:
Physical:

Feeling energized, "wired"
Reduced sleep need
Increased libido
Feeling physically stronger
More assertive body language
Restlessness, need to move
Psychological:

Feeling invincible
Everything seems easy
Irritability when challenged
Increased competitiveness
Reduced caution
"I've figured it out" feeling
Trading-Specific:

Position sizes creeping up
Taking more trades than usual
Seeing setups everywhere
Dismissing risk ("I can handle it")
Override rules ("This is different")
Feeling like you have "the touch"
The Intervention Protocol:
If you recognize elevated testosterone state:

1. Forced Position Size Reduction

Cut your position size by 50% immediately. Yes, this will feel wrong. You'll feel like you're "leaving money on the table."

That feeling is exactly why you need to do it.

2. Trade Frequency Limits

Maximum 50% of your normal trade frequency. If you usually take 4 trades per day, maximum 2.

This prevents you from overtrading during the elevated state.

3. Mandatory Review Process

Before every trade, answer out loud:

"Is this A-grade setup or am I forcing it?"
"Is this position size from my system or from my ego?"
"Am I trading my plan or trading my confidence?" 4. Third-Party Accountability

Tell someone you trust: "I'm in a winning streak. I need you to challenge me if I start talking about taking bigger positions or acting overconfident."

External perspective counteracts internal overconfidence.

5. Physical Grounding

Yoga or stretching (reduces testosterone slightly)
Longer meditation sessions
Avoid additional testosterone-boosting activities (heavy lifting, competitive sports, stimulants) 6. Remember Variance

Write this where you can see it: "I am not better than I was last week. I caught favorable variance. My edge is the same. My skill is the same. Only my testosterone has changed."

## The Optimal State - Balanced Hormones

The goal isn't to eliminate cortisol or testosterone. The goal is optimization:

Optimal Cortisol:
Slightly elevated in morning: Gives you energy and focus to start trading
Declining through day: Gradual decrease as trading session progresses
Low in evening: Allows sleep and recovery
How to optimize: Consistent sleep schedule, morning sunlight, morning exercise, stress management

Optimal Testosterone:
Stable baseline: Not fluctuating wildly based on wins/losses
Slight elevation on winning days: Feels good, but not intoxicating
Doesn't crater on losing days: Maintains confidence through normal variance
How to optimize: Regular exercise, adequate sleep, healthy fats in diet, vitamin D, zinc, stress management

The Integration:
Elite traders maintain relatively stable hormone levels regardless of short-term performance.

They don't spike into overconfidence on winning streaks.
They don't crash into despair on losing streaks.
They maintain psychological equilibrium because they maintain hormonal equilibrium.

This is biochemical discipline.

## Real-Time Tracking

For the next 30 days, add a "Hormonal State Assessment" to your trading journal:

Before Trading Session:

Rate 1-10:

Energy level
Confidence level
Sleep quality (last night)
Stress level
Recent performance streak (wins/losses)
Identify your state:

⚠️ High Cortisol (stressed, fearful, foggy)
⚠️ High Testosterone (overconfident, invincible feeling)
✓ Balanced (calm confidence, alert but not wired)
Adjust accordingly:

High Cortisol: Reduce size 50% or skip trading
High Testosterone: Reduce size 50% and implement stricter rules
Balanced: Trade normally
After 30 days, you'll see patterns:

"Every time I rate confidence above 8, I overtrade and lose."
"Every time I rate stress above 6, my win rate drops."
"My best trading happens when both are moderate (5-7 range)."

These patterns are your hormonal signature.

## Key Takeaways:

✓ Cortisol is neurotoxic at chronic elevation—it literally impairs your brain's ability to think, learn, and remember

✓ The cortisol spiral compounds losses—each loss raises cortisol, which impairs decision-making, which creates more losses

✓ Cortisol requires active clearance—you must intervene with specific protocols to bring it back to baseline

✓ Testosterone rises 20-25% after wins—this is measurable, predictable, and dangerous past certain thresholds

✓ The Winner Effect creates overconfidence—elevated testosterone makes you blind to risk and convinced of your enhanced skill

✓ God Mode usually precedes catastrophe—feeling invincible is the most dangerous psychological state in trading

✓ The Loser Effect is equally destructive—testosterone crash plus cortisol spike creates paralysis and poor decision-making

✓ Hormones create different traders—you're literally a different person biochemically during winning vs. losing streaks

✓ Position sizing must adjust to hormonal state—cut size during both extremes (high cortisol OR high testosterone)

✓ Hormonal awareness is competitive advantage—most traders are unconscious puppets to their chemistry; awareness breaks the strings

## The Assignment:

Week 1-2: Recognition Training
Add hormonal state assessment to daily journal
Track energy, confidence, stress levels
Note when you feel "off" in either direction
Correlate hormonal states with trading performance
Week 3-4: Pattern Identification
Review two weeks of data
Identify your warning signs for:
High cortisol state
High testosterone state
Optimal balanced state
Create your personal hormone profile
Week 5-6: Intervention Practice
When you recognize elevated states, implement protocols
Cut position size 50% during extremes
Track: Did intervention prevent poor decisions?
Notice: How long does it take hormones to normalize?
Week 7-8: Integration
Hormonal state assessment becomes automatic
Position sizing adjusts naturally to state
Develop early warning system (catch elevated states before they peak)
Build lifestyle practices that stabilize baseline hormones

## The Truth:

Sarah figured it out.

She started tracking her hormonal state alongside her trading performance. The pattern was undeniable.

Mid-cycle: Elevated testosterone, overconfidence, position size creep, eventual blowup.
Pre-menstrual: Elevated cortisol, paralysis, missed opportunities.

Once she saw the pattern, she implemented the protocol:

Mid-cycle (high testosterone phase):

Maximum position size: 50% of normal
Maximum trades per day: 3 (instead of 6)
Mandatory rule checklist before every trade
Extra scrutiny on "I'm hot" feelings
Pre-menstrual (high cortisol phase):

Reduce trading frequency
Focus only on A+ setups
If stress above 7/10, no trading that day
Extra recovery time after any loss
Optimal window (days 1-12 of cycle):

Trade normally with full parameters
Result: Her consistency returned. Her monthly returns stabilized. The wild swings disappeared.

Not because her trading skill changed. Because she stopped letting her hormones trade her account.

She still experiences the chemical fluctuations—that's biology, she can't eliminate it. But now she recognizes them and adjusts for them.

She's not fighting her chemistry. She's managing it.

<hr />

The brutal truth about trading: Your hormones are trading your account whether you acknowledge them or not.

Cortisol is clouding your judgment during losing streaks.
Testosterone is inflating your confidence during winning streaks.
Both are pushing you toward extremes—toward the catastrophic mistakes that destroy accounts.

Most traders never realize this. They think they're making rational decisions. They think their changing risk tolerance is "learning and adapting."

They don't realize they're biochemical puppets—dancing to the rhythm of cortisol and testosterone, with no awareness of the strings.

But now you know.

You know that the foggy thinking after losses isn't weakness—it's cortisol.
You know that the invincible feeling after wins isn't enlightenment—it's testosterone.
You know that both states are dangerous and require active management.

The question isn't whether your hormones will fluctuate. They will. That's biology.

The question is: Will you let them trade blindly, or will you manage them consciously?

<hr />

In the next lesson, we're exploring Decision Fatigue & The Cognitive Battery—why your worst trades happen at the end of the session, why willpower is a finite resource that depletes with each decision, and why "pushing through" is often the worst thing you can do.

Because hormones aren't the only biological constraint on your trading.

You also have a limited number of good decisions per day.

And most traders don't realize they've run out until after they've blown up.

Remember: Your hormones are trading your account. Chemical awareness is competitive advantage.
