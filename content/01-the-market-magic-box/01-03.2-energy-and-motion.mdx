Now let's bring the box to life. Watch what happens when green and red particles collide.
This is a transaction between a buyer and a seller happening right in front of you.
Every collision you see means a trade is taking place — one particle changing hands.

It's literally the transfer of ownership of a particle, which is a share of the float.
But here's something crucial to understand: a particle isn't created or destroyed during this process.
It's just a transfer of ownership.

Let me give you a couple of examples to make this crystal clear.

**Example 1:** Let's say a seller sells his share to a buyer who already owns a share.
Now the buyer owns two shares, and the seller is left without any.
The seller's particle was transferred to the buyer, so the green particle now has a bag of two particles.

Example 2: Now imagine someone from the sidelines — someone who has cash but no particle yet —
comes in and buys a share from a seller.
The buyer now has the share, the particle. The seller's particle transferred to the buyer.
Same result: ownership changed hands.

Notice something important here: the total amount of particles in the box stays exactly the same.
The float doesn't grow or shrink with each trade — it just reshuffles.

**Price is the Output**

The price you see isn't something the particles carry with them. Price is the output of these transactions, these collisions.
It emerges from the interactions, not from the particles themselves.

**Volume = Energy**

And here's where it all clicks together: these transactions, these ownership transfers — that's volume.
The more collisions happening, the higher the volume.
So volume intensity represents the energy of the market. It's the pulse, the heartbeat.

Want to move price? You need a surge in collisions. You need energy.
That's why we say **volume precedes price**.
The energy builds first — you see the collisions increasing — and then price reacts.
It's cause and effect.

Watch the volume meter as collisions ramp up. That rising bar is telling you something important:
conviction is building. Participants are committing. Energy is flowing into the system.

And when that energy fades? When collisions slow down? That's when price stalls, consolidates, or reverses.
The market is catching its breath.

  <AlertTitle>Watch the Collisions</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    In the visualization below, you can see red particles (sellers) and green
    particles (buyers) moving around. First, observe them drifting without
    collisions. Then, use the Leva controls panel (top right) to enable
    collisions by checking "Enable Collisions". Watch what happens when they
    collide: the red particle dissolves, and the green particle becomes a larger
    "bag" containing two particles. This represents the transaction — ownership
    transfer from seller to buyer. You can also adjust the collision intensity
    to see how volume (the number of collisions) relates to market energy.

  <AlertTitle>Key Takeaway</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Each time two particles meet, a trade is born. The faster they collide, the
    more energy fills the market — that energy is what we call volume.

  <AlertTitle>What You've Learned</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You've discovered how transactions create energy in the market — each
    collision between buyers and sellers transfers ownership and generates
    volume. You now understand that particles (shares) are never created or
    destroyed in trades, only transferred, and that volume is the measurable
    energy flowing through the market. Most importantly, you've learned the
    foundational principle: <strong>volume precedes price</strong>. Energy
    builds through collisions first, then price responds. When collisions surge,
    conviction is building; when they slow, the market is catching its breath.
    You can now see trades not as abstract numbers but as physical collisions
    happening in real-time.

  <AlertTitle>What's Next: Equilibrium and Pressure</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Those collisions don't happen randomly — they cluster around specific price
    levels where buyers and sellers meet. In the next lesson, we'll add{' '}
    <strong>structure</strong> to the chaos by introducing supply and demand
    zones. You'll see how sellers concentrate at the top (supply), buyers gather
    at the bottom (demand), and battles rage in the middle (the spread). You'll
    also discover how sideline liquidity — the gray particles watching and
    waiting — can shift the entire balance of power when they finally decide to
    enter. Get ready to watch the market breathe through compression and
    expansion.
